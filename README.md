In this Azure project, I've leveraged VNet peering to construct a robust and secure network environment. The project involved the creation of multiple virtual networks, each hosting a combination of public and private servers. Through meticulous configuration of VNet peering, bidirectional connections were established between these virtual networks, forming a unified and highly versatile network infrastructure.

With VNet peering in place, I facilitated seamless communication between the virtual machines residing within these networks. This project underscores the efficiency and security offered by Azure technology, ensuring data privacy while enabling optimal connectivity between public and private servers.

By sharing this project on GitHub, I aim to provide a valuable resource for those looking to enhance their understanding of VNet peering in Azure. Whether you're seeking to optimize network communication, bolster security, or create a dynamic cloud-based network infrastructure, this project serves as a practical and insightful guide.
