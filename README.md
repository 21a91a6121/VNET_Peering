Introduction:
This project demonstrates the power of Azure technology by configuring Virtual Network (VNet) peering to create a seamlessly interconnected network environment. With three virtual networks, we established a robust network infrastructure, facilitating communication between public and private servers. This project provides an in-depth guide on VNet peering, enhancing network connectivity and versatility.

Setting Up Three Virtual Networks:
Our project commenced with the creation of three separate virtual networks. Virtual Network 1 hosted a public server, while Virtual Networks 2 and 3 each housed a private server. This structuring allowed us to compartmentalize and secure our resources while ensuring data privacy and accessibility.

Configuring VNet Peering:
To enable communication between these networks, we meticulously set up VNet peering. This involved creating bidirectional peering connections between Virtual Network 1 and Virtual Network 2, Virtual Network 2 and Virtual Network 3, and Virtual Network 3 and Virtual Network 1. This intricate web of connections formed a unified network environment.

Establishing Network Pathways:
We validated our network peering by establishing a connectivity path from the public server in Virtual Network 1 to the private server in Virtual Network 2 and from there to the private server in Virtual Network 3. This network pathway demonstrated the seamless connectivity achieved through VNet peering.

Streamlining Network Operations:
In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive guide to implementing VNet peering in Azure. The seamless interconnection of three virtual networks, from public to private servers, showcases the efficiency and versatility of Azure's networking capabilities. This project is a valuable resource for anyone looking to optimize network communication and security in a cloud environment, fostering a robust and dynamic network infrastructure.
